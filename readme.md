All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only â€” for both performance and usability reasons, we strongly recommend avoiding WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of your projects.

Any of our WordPress plugins may also be loaded as "Must-Use" plugins (meaning that they load first, and cannot be deactivated) by using our free [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script in the `mu-plugins` directory.
